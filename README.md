Quadcopter
==========

This project will be set up from the ground up to develop the software for a quadcopter.

For the first version, to get to a flying quadcopter we'll focus on the following parts:
* Flight controller board
  * Application and libraries
* Remote control application
  * Running on a Linux desktop

In future iteration we are planning to add:
* Android remote control application
* More telemetry support
* Camera support
* GPS support
